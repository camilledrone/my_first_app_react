# my_first_app_react
Development of a game with react js

## concepts covered

* discovery of the declarative and flexible js library
* notion of "component", React.Component
* method "render"
* "props", information flow from parents to children
* "state", local state, 
* interactive component
* feed back information, To retrieve data from multiple children, or to allow two child components to communicate with each other, you must instead declare their shared state in the parent component. This parent component can then pass this state back to them through the props; in this way, the child components are synchronised with each other and with the parent component.
* add js functions
* controlled components
* component functions
* immutability
* store a record
